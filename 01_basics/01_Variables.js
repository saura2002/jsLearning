// 1. Basics of Variables
// Definition: A variable is a container for storing data values.
// Declaration Keywords:
// var (function-scoped)
// let (block-scoped)
// const (block-scoped, cannot be reassigned) 
*/
/* prefer not use var 
because of issue in block and functional scope.
*/
/* 
let blockScoped; // Declare outside the block
if (true) {
    blockScoped = "I'm block-scoped"; // Initialize inside the block
    var functionScoped = "I'm function-scoped";
}
console.log(blockScoped); // Logs: "I'm block-scoped"
console.log(functionScoped); // Logs: "I'm function-scoped"
Remember, let variables are block-scoped, so they wonâ€™t be accessible outside the block they are declared in unless you declare them in a wider scope first.
